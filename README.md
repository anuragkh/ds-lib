## Data Structure Library

A C++ library of selected data-structures that I've implemented (or ported)
during the course of my research.

## Building the library

To build a static library of all the data structures, simply run:

```
make
```

## Benchmarks

To build the benchmarks, run the following:

```
make bench
```

To run a particular benchmark:

```
./bin/stbench
```
